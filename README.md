# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

 1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

  - I started with the first most "root" class that we have, and then moved on from there. This helps me better understand how each class iteracts with eachother as well as exactly what the test are asking for.

 2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?

  - It was hard at first to understand the intended purpose for the code, and you really have to talk yourself through what is doing what.

 3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase?

  - After figuring out what the purpose of the methods are, it very straight forward and simple to debug and solve and issues from there.

 4. What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

  - Theres not much to do, after going through the bugs, you have to make slight changes to the code, and thats it really.
